            Floral Tea is a tea importer and wholesaler based in Vietnam. We hand
            blend and custom craft the worldâ€™s finest organic teas and botanicals.
            Our teas are carefully selected directly from growers, each one offering
            a unique story.

          <p>The seeds that formed the foundation of Floral were
            first planted in 1996 when Steve Schwartz began his journey of extensive
            study in preventative medicine at the Ayurvedic Institute in New Mexico.
            Since then, Floral has become a leading purveyor of organic and
            specialty teas. Each year Steve travels extensively, returning with rare
            and unique teas from around the world.</p>
